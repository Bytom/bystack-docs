## Deploy smart contract

we use remix to write,compile,deploy the smart contract
remix is a "no-setup required" browser IDE for developing EVM smart contracts.

### 1.Prepare smart contract

Go to [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
There are some contracts in the File Explorer. Select any of these contracts. In this example, we use `Storage.sol`, or you can write smart contract yourself

On the left bar, select the `Solidity Compiler` and compile the contract.

### 3.Deploy smart contract

On the left bar, select the `Deploy and Run` option. Select `injected web3` as the environment. This will open a metamask popup for you to confirm connecting your Metamask to Remix. Hit confirm.

Now that your account is connected, you are able to deploy the contract. Press the Deploy button. A metamask pop-up will appear asking you to confirm. Confirm the transaction

### 4. Interact with smart contract

Now, you are able to interact with the contract through Remix. For `Storage.sol`, input 10 and click store. This will open a Metamask pop-up asking you to confirm. Confirm the transaction. Then, click retrieve to get the number, which should be 10.
