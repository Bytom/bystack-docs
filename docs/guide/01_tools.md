# Tools

## Smart Contracts

You can build many types of smart contracts on BMC, including but not limited to cryptocurrency exchanges, smart contract-based dApps, decentralized finance, etc.

On BMC, you can use Solidity language to write smart contracts, if you have any questions, please refer to [ official documenatation of Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/)。

## IDE and possible libraries

Several IDEs and libraries can help you develop and deploy smart contracts.

- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)：A powerful open source tool that can write smart contracts online, without installing or setting up a development environment, you can operate directly after logging in. Remix also provides tools for online code debugging, static analysis and deployment.
- [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/)：A collection of libraries that allow you to interact with local or remote Ethereum nodes using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.
- [Truffle](http://trufflesuite.com/docs/teams/quickstart)：Truffle is a development framework for the Ethereum-based Solidity language, itself based on Javascript. The client is deeply integrated, providing a project construction mechanism like `maven` or `gradle`, which can automatically generate relevant directories, provide contract abstract interfaces, and provide console and monitoring contracts.

## Faucet

You can use [faucet](https://bmc.bytom.io/faucet/) to get test coins.
